- Register for an event - subscribe an initiative in just a few clicks.
- Publish an event - publicitate your event providing all the necessary details.
- User and organization profiles - different attributes for each type of profile, possibility of editing your information and viewing other members profiles.
- Subscribe categories and organizations - receive notifications when a new event of a category or organization you subscribed is published.
